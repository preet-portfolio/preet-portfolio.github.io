  Programming : A set of instructions to tell the computer what to do.
  Syntax: how we write instructions to a computer.
  with english, we need a full stop(.) to end a sentence.
  Some programming languages have a different way of writing syntax. 
  JS care a little.

  Order Matters:
  Art of programming is to write the code in the correct order.
  Computers are Exactly the same.

  GIGO: Garbage in, Garbage out.
  The computr does what its told.

Recap:
Its a set of instructions to tell the computer what to do.
A sequences of small commands, one at each time.


Where does JS fit in?
There are Hundreds of languages.

As the years go by, Different languages come and go.
Most programmeers will learn and use multiple languages over time.

Why?
Why isn't there just one computer language?
Machine Code.

Machine Code is 0 and 1s.
code your computer can understand.
but how?
Processor.
A small machine that works with electrical inputs.

we give our computer instructions. Not all processors the same.

Low Level Languages

All computer languages are just a compromise.

High Level Languages
As you move away from the CPU, you worry less about hardware.
this is easier to write.
but it can be slower as its not optimised at the CPU level.

Javascript is a high level language.

How do we write code?
Recall, source code is just text.
so you can write js anywhere.


Compiling:
A program that converts your sources code to machine code.
A seperate file is created.
the can click on the .exe file to run.
the end user never see your source code.

Compilors are CPU dependant.
Faster
Source code stays with you


Interpreted:the user's machine reads the source code.

the user is given the source code.
the user's computer runs the source code.
